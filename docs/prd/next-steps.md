# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review the FamilySync PRD and create detailed UX/UI specifications focusing on:

1. **Mobile-First Interface Design** - Translate the weekly view and task management concepts into specific screen layouts and interaction patterns
2. **User Flow Optimization** - Design the family onboarding experience and daily coordination workflows for maximum adoption
3. **Visual Design System** - Create the color coding, typography, and component library that supports the "Glance-and-Go" paradigm
4. **Accessibility Implementation** - Ensure WCAG AA compliance is built into the design foundation

Prioritize the core user journeys from Epic 1 and Epic 2, with particular attention to mobile touch interactions and offline state communication.

## Architect Prompt

Please review both the **FamilySync PRD** (this document) and the **Front-End Specification** (`docs/front-end-spec.md`) to create a comprehensive technical architecture that supports the defined user experience and business requirements.

**Key Focus Areas:**

1. **Frontend Architecture Supporting UX Spec** - Design React component architecture, state management, and routing patterns that enable the defined user flows, weekly dashboard layout, and mobile-first interactions
2. **Offline-First Data Architecture** - Design sync strategies, conflict resolution patterns, and IndexedDB persistence supporting the 7-day offline capability and seamless family coordination workflows
3. **PWA Service Worker Design** - Create caching strategies, update mechanisms, and background sync that maintain the "Glance-and-Go" performance targets from the front-end spec
4. **API and Database Design** - Design RESTful endpoints and SQLite schema supporting family data isolation, task/event management, and the specific UI components defined in the front-end spec
5. **Security and Performance Integration** - Implement JWT authentication, data encryption, and mobile performance optimization that meets both PRD requirements and front-end UX goals

**Critical Integration Requirements:**
- Ensure API design supports the specific user flows and component interactions detailed in the front-end spec
- Design data models that efficiently support the weekly dashboard view, quick-add workflows, and family coordination features
- Plan offline sync architecture that maintains the responsive, reliable experience defined in the UX goals
- Address technical assumptions from PRD while ensuring compatibility with the defined UI/UX patterns

**Technical Risk Areas from Both Documents:**
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous family member edits during async collaboration scenarios
- Service worker implementation supporting both offline functionality and the defined performance targets
- Database migration strategy from SQLite to PostgreSQL that maintains user experience continuity
- Mobile browser PWA compatibility across iOS 13+ and Android 9+ supporting the defined touch interactions

Create an architecture that seamlessly bridges the business requirements (PRD) with the user experience vision (front-end spec) for successful solo developer implementation.
