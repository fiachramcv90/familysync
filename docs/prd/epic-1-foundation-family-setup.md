# Epic 1 Foundation & Family Setup

**Epic Goal:** Establish core project infrastructure (Next.js PWA, Supabase integration) and basic family account system while delivering immediate user value through a functional family dashboard that demonstrates coordination benefits within the first user session.

**Epic Timeline:** 4 weeks (standard foundation setup with minimal complexity buffer)  
**Complexity Level:** LOW-MODERATE - Well-documented Next.js + Supabase patterns with established best practices  
**Risk Mitigation:** Weekly progress reviews with focus on Supabase integration and authentication flow validation

## Story 1.1 Project Infrastructure Setup

**Timeline Estimate:** 1 week  
**Complexity Level:** LOW  
**Risk Factors:** Next.js PWA configuration, Supabase project setup, initial environment configuration

As a **developer**,  
I want **to establish the foundational Next.js PWA and Supabase API integration with build processes and basic routing**,  
so that **the development environment is ready for implementing family coordination features**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **React PWA project initialized** with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and PWA service worker configuration
2. **Node.js/Express API project set up** with TypeScript, basic middleware, and CORS configuration  
3. **SQLite database connection established** with basic connection testing and error handling
4. **Development build processes working** for both frontend and backend with hot reload
5. **Basic project structure documented** in README with setup and run instructions
6. **Environment configuration** working for development, with placeholder for production settings

## Story 1.2 User Authentication System

**Timeline Estimate:** 1 week  
**Complexity Level:** LOW-MODERATE  
**Risk Factors:** Supabase Auth integration, Row Level Security policy setup, JWT token management

As a **family member**,  
I want **to create a secure personal account and log in reliably**,  
so that **my family's coordination data remains private and accessible only to authorized family members**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **User registration endpoint** accepts email, password, and basic profile information with validation
2. **Secure password hashing** implemented using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
3. **JWT authentication system** working with token generation, validation, and expiration handling
4. **Login/logout functionality** with secure token storage and automatic expiration handling
5. **Basic user profile management** allowing name and email updates
6. **Registration and login UI** mobile-optimized with clear error messaging and validation feedback

## Story 1.3 Family Account Creation and Linking

**Timeline Estimate:** 1 week  
**Complexity Level:** MODERATE  
**Risk Factors:** Family invitation system design, data isolation validation, multi-user coordination logic

As a **family member**,  
I want **to easily create a family account and invite my partner to join**,  
so that **we can start coordinating our shared responsibilities immediately**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Family creation process** allows naming the family and generates unique family ID
2. **Family invitation system** generates secure invite codes or links for family member addition
3. **Family joining process** allows new users to join existing family using invitation method
4. **Family member management** shows list of connected family members with basic profile info
5. **Family setup UI** provides guided onboarding flow with clear next steps
6. **Data isolation enforced** ensuring families can only access their own coordination data

## Story 1.4 Basic Family Dashboard

**Timeline Estimate:** 1 week  
**Complexity Level:** MODERATE  
**Risk Factors:** Weekly calendar UI complexity, mobile responsiveness across devices, real-time family data display

As a **family member**,  
I want **to see a clean weekly view of our family's shared responsibilities**,  
so that **I can immediately understand the coordination value and begin using the app**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Weekly calendar interface** displays current week with clear day-by-day layout optimized for mobile
2. **Basic task display** shows existing family tasks with assignment and status visibility
3. **Family member identification** clearly indicates who is assigned to each task or event
4. **Current date highlighting** and easy week navigation (previous/next week arrows)
5. **Empty state messaging** guides new families on how to add their first tasks
6. **Mobile-responsive layout** works seamlessly on phone screens with touch-friendly interactions

## Epic 1 Milestone Checkpoints

**Overview:** Epic 1 establishes the foundation - success here prevents delays in all subsequent epics.

### Week 1 Checkpoint: Infrastructure Foundation (Story 1.1)
**Deliverable:** Next.js + Supabase project with basic routing and PWA configuration  
**Success Criteria:**
