# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
FamilySync delivers a clean, scannable weekly interface that busy professionals can quickly understand and update during brief coordination moments. The design prioritizes immediate visual comprehension over feature discovery, with a focus on reducing cognitive load during high-stress family coordination scenarios. Every interaction should feel faster and more reliable than text message coordination.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Glance-and-Go Navigation**: Primary information visible without scrolling or drilling down
- **One-Thumb Operation**: All critical functions accessible with single-handed phone use
- **Tap-to-Complete Workflows**: Minimize text input; maximize quick status updates and assignments
- **Visual Status Communication**: Color coding and icons convey task ownership and completion instantly
- **Context-Aware Defaults**: Smart pre-filling based on family patterns and previous entries

## Core Screens and Views
- **Weekly Overview Dashboard** - Primary landing screen showing all family tasks and events in weekly calendar format
- **Quick Task Creation Modal** - Simple overlay for adding new tasks with assignment and due date
- **Family Member Profile View** - Individual task lists and availability status for each family member
- **Task Detail Screen** - Expanded view for complex tasks requiring notes or sub-tasks
- **Family Settings Screen** - User management, notification preferences, and account settings

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensuring the app is usable by family members with visual, motor, or cognitive accessibility needs. This includes high-contrast color schemes, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.

## Branding
Warm, professional aesthetic that feels trustworthy for family data while maintaining visual simplicity. Clean typography with generous white space to reduce visual clutter during busy moments. Color palette emphasizes calm blues and greens with high-contrast accent colors for status indicators.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized primarily for mobile phones but functional across all devices. Responsive design adapts to tablets and desktop browsers while maintaining mobile-first interaction patterns. Works seamlessly across iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and other modern mobile browsers.

## Technical Risk Assessment

**HIGH COMPLEXITY / HIGH RISK AREAS:**

1. **Offline-First Data Synchronization (Epic 3)**
   - *Risk:* Complex conflict resolution when multiple family members edit simultaneously
   - *Complexity Factors:* IndexedDB limitations, service worker lifecycle, optimistic UI consistency
   - *Mitigation Required:* Prototype conflict scenarios, implement "last-write-wins" with manual resolution fallback

2. **PWA Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - *Risk:* iOS Safari PWA limitations vs Android Chrome capabilities
   - *Complexity Factors:* Service worker behavior differences, offline storage quotas, install prompts
   - *Mitigation Required:* Device-specific testing matrix, progressive enhancement strategy

3. **Real-time Family Data Consistency**
   - *Risk:* Family members seeing inconsistent task states during sync conflicts
   - *Complexity Factors:* WebSocket alternatives for PWA, polling frequency vs battery impact
   - *Mitigation Required:* Implement polling-based sync with exponential backoff, clear sync status indicators

**MODERATE COMPLEXITY AREAS:**

4. **SQLite to PostgreSQL Migration**
   - *Risk:* Data migration complexity at scale, schema changes during transition
   - *Mitigation:* Define migration triggers (1,000 families), plan schema versioning

5. **Mobile Touch Interface Optimization**
   - *Risk:* Touch targets too small, gestures conflicting with browser behavior
   - *Mitigation:* Follow iOS/Android HIG guidelines, extensive device testing

**AREAS REQUIRING ARCHITECTURAL INVESTIGATION:**
- Service worker update strategies for seamless app updates
- IndexedDB performance patterns for family data queries
- JWT token refresh mechanisms in PWA offline context
- Family data encryption key management and sharing
