# Story S2.1: Authentication Flow Integration Testing

## Status
⚠️ **IMPORTANT** - Not Started

## Story
**As a** family member,  
**I want** the complete authentication flow to work reliably from login through dashboard access,  
**so that** I can confidently use the application without authentication-related issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **End-to-end login test passes consistently** with real user credentials
2. **Registration flow works** and redirects properly to dashboard
3. **Session persistence works** across browser refreshes and navigation
4. **Protected route access control** functions correctly for authenticated/unauthenticated users
5. **Logout functionality works** and properly clears session state
6. **Error handling displays** appropriate messages for invalid credentials and network issues

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Create comprehensive authentication test suite** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Update existing login test to use real authentication flow
  - [ ] Create registration flow test with dashboard redirect verification
  - [ ] Test authentication with various credential combinations
  - [ ] Verify proper error messaging for authentication failures
- [ ] **Test session persistence and state management** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Test session persistence across browser refresh
  - [ ] Verify session state during navigation between pages
  - [ ] Test session recovery after browser restart
  - [ ] Validate token refresh functionality
- [ ] **Verify protected route access control** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test unauthenticated access to protected routes
  - [ ] Verify authenticated access to dashboard and other protected pages
  - [ ] Test redirect behavior for unauthorized access attempts
  - [ ] Validate route guards work properly
- [ ] **Test logout and session cleanup** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Verify logout clears all session data
  - [ ] Test redirect to login page after logout
  - [ ] Confirm cookies and local storage cleanup
  - [ ] Validate that protected routes become inaccessible after logout
- [ ] **Implement robust error handling testing** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test network failure scenarios during authentication
  - [ ] Verify error messages for invalid credentials
  - [ ] Test timeout handling for slow authentication responses
  - [ ] Validate error recovery and retry mechanisms

## Dev Notes

### Current State Analysis
Authentication appears to be working based on recent commits, but lacks comprehensive testing to ensure reliability. The login route and Supabase integration have been debugged, but the complete flow needs validation.

### Testing Strategy

**Authentication Flow Scenarios:**
1. **Happy Path**: Successful login → dashboard → navigation → logout
2. **Registration Path**: New user registration → email verification → first login
3. **Error Scenarios**: Invalid credentials, network failures, expired sessions
4. **Edge Cases**: Multiple tabs, session expiry, concurrent logins

**Test Environments:**
- Local development with real Supabase instance
- Staging environment with test users
- Different browsers and devices for compatibility

### Architecture Context

**Current Authentication Architecture:**
```typescript
// Supabase Auth Integration:
- src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts - Login endpoint
- src/lib/supabase-server.ts - Server-side client
- Cookie-based session management
- RLS policies for data isolation
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- E2E tests for complete user flows
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Unit tests for authentication utilities
- Performance tests for login response times

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Stories S1.1, S1.2, S1.3 (stable foundation needed for reliable testing)
- **Authentication System**: Must be working (appears to be from recent commits)
- **Dashboard**: Must be functional for complete flow testing

## Testing

### Test Location Standards
- E2E tests: `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/integration/auth-flow.test.ts`
- API tests: `src/__tests__/api/auth.test.ts`

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios

```typescript
// E2E Authentication Test Examples:
describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
  test('complete login to dashboard flow', async ({ page }) => {
    // Login with valid credentials
    // Verify redirect to dashboard
    // Confirm dashboard loads properly
    // Test navigation to other protected routes
    // Verify session persistence across refresh
  });

  test('registration and first login', async ({ page }) => {
    // Register new user
    // Verify email sent (if applicable)
    // Complete registration process
    // First login and dashboard access
  });

  test('logout and session cleanup', async ({ page }) => {
    // Login successfully
    // Navigate to dashboard
    // Logout
    // Verify redirect to login
    // Confirm protected routes inaccessible
  });
});
```

### Performance Requirements
- Login response time < 2 seconds
- Dashboard load after auth < 3 seconds
- Session check response < 500ms
- Logout response < 1 second

## Security Testing

### Security Test Requirements
- [ ] Verify session tokens are httpOnly and secure
- [ ] Test CSRF protection on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Validate session expiry and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Confirm RLS policies prevent cross-family data access
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts

### Error Handling Validation
- [ ] Network timeouts during authentication
- [ ] Invalid token handling
- [ ] Session hijacking protection
- [ ] Rate limiting on login attempts
