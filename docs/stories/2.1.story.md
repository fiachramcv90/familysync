## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 (Basic Family Dashboard) successfully implemented the foundation for displaying family tasks in a weekly view with proper state management using React Query and Zustand. The dashboard includes components for WeekNavigation, WeekView, DayColumn, and TaskCard which provide the display context for newly created tasks. The task creation functionality will integrate with the existing useFamilyTasks hook and task display architecture.

- State Management: React Query 5.0+ for server state with Zustand 4.4+ for client UI state
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with built-in authentication and real-time capabilities
- TypeScript: 5.2+ for type safety across components and API calls
- Form Management: React Hook Form for task creation and validation
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E testing

**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Task Creation Components Structure:**
```
src/components/
├── task/
│   ├── QuickAddModal.tsx          # Main task creation modal
│   ├── TaskTypeSelector.tsx       # Task vs Event type selection  
│   ├── FamilyMemberSelect.tsx     # Assignee selection dropdown
│   ├── TaskTitleInput.tsx         # Title input with validation

    └── Input.tsx                  # Base input components
```

**State Management Pattern for Task Creation:**
```typescript
// React Query mutation for task creation
export const useCreateTask = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (taskData: CreateTaskInput) => 
      taskService.createTask(taskData),
    onMutate: async (newTask) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['tasks'] });
      
      // Snapshot previous value
      const previousTasks = queryClient.getQueryData(['tasks']);
      
      // Optimistically update cache
      queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks'], (old: Task[] = []) => [
        ...old,
        { ...newTask, id: `temp-${Date.now()}`, status: 'pending', createdAt: new Date() }
      ]);
      
      return { previousTasks };
    },
    onError: (err, newTask, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks'], context?.previousTasks);
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['tasks'] });
    },
  });
};

// Zustand store for modal UI state
interface AppStore {
  showQuickAdd: boolean;
  openQuickAdd: () => void;
  closeQuickAdd: () => void;
}
```

**Core Workflows Integration** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Quick Task Creation Workflow:**
1. User taps FAB on weekly dashboard
2. QuickAddModal opens with form focused on title input
3. User fills required fields (title, assignee) and optional fields (description, due date, type)
4. Form validation occurs real-time with visual feedback
5. On submit, optimistic UI update shows task in weekly view immediately
6. API call creates task in Supabase with family data isolation
7. On success, cache updated with server-generated task ID
8. On error, optimistic update rolled back with error message
9. Modal closes and user sees task in appropriate day column

**Family Data Isolation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All task creation must include family ID filtering from authenticated user context
- Family member assignment validation ensures only family members can be assigned tasks
- RLS policies on Supabase prevent cross-family data access
- API middleware enforces family membership validation

**Mobile-First Design Requirements** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Touch targets minimum 44px for accessibility compliance
- Modal optimized for mobile viewport with proper spacing
- Form inputs use mobile-specific keyboard types (text, email, etc.)
- Calendar picker designed for touch interaction with large date targets
- Floating action button positioned for thumb reachability

**Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Never expose family IDs in client-side code - derive from authenticated user
- Validate all task creation inputs server-side with proper sanitization
- Implement rate limiting for task creation API endpoint
- Use proper CSRF protection for form submissions
- Sanitize task titles and descriptions to prevent XSS attacks

### Testing Requirements

├── components/task/
│   ├── QuickAddModal.test.tsx     # Modal component tests
│   ├── TaskTypeSelector.test.tsx  # Type selection tests
│   ├── FamilyMemberSelect.test.tsx # Assignee selection tests

    ├── tasks.json                 # Test task data
    └── familyMembers.json         # Test family data
```

**Required Test Coverage:**
- Component rendering with different props and states
- Form validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Family member assignment with proper validation
- Task type selection and visual feedback
- Due date picker functionality and edge cases
- API endpoint with family data isolation validation
- Error handling for failed task creation
- Optimistic updates and rollback scenarios
- Accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Mobile responsive behavior across different viewport sizes

**Testing Patterns for Task Creation:**
```typescript
// Component test example
describe('QuickAddModal', () => {
  it('creates task with required fields only', async () => {
    const mockCreateTask = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockTask);
    
    render(<QuickAddModal isOpen onClose={jest.fn()} />, { 
      wrapper: createTestWrapper() 
    });
    
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/task title/i), 'Buy groceries');
    await userEvent.selectOptions(screen.getByLabelText(/assign to/i), 'user-123');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create task/i }));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockCreateTask).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        title: 'Buy groceries',
        assigneeId: 'user-123',
        category: 'task',
        priority: 'medium'
      });
    });
  });

  it('shows validation errors for empty required fields', async () => {
    render(<QuickAddModal isOpen onClose={jest.fn()} />);
    
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create task/i }));
    
    expect(screen.getByText(/title is required/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/assignee is required/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

// API test example
describe('POST /api/tasks', () => {
  it('creates task with proper family isolation', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/tasks')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
      .send({
        title: 'Test Task',
        assigneeId: 'family-member-id',
        category: 'task'
      })
      .expect(201);
      
    expect(response.body).toMatchObject({
      title: 'Test Task',
      familyId: testUser.familyId,
      assigneeId: 'family-member-id',
      createdById: testUser.id,
      status: 'pending',
      syncVersion: 1
    });
  });

  it('prevents task creation with invalid assignee', async () => {
    await request(app)
      .post('/api/tasks')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
      .send({
        title: 'Malicious Task',
        assigneeId: 'other-family-member-id'
      })
      .expect(400);
  });
});
```

**Performance Testing Requirements:**
- Task creation should complete within 2 seconds on 3G mobile connections
- Optimistic UI updates should be immediate (< 100ms)
- Form validation should provide feedback within 300ms of input
- Modal opening/closing animations should be smooth at 60fps
