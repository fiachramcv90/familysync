## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 are currently in Draft status. This dashboard story assumes foundational infrastructure (1.1), authentication system (1.2), and database schema (1.3) will be available. The dashboard can be developed with mock data initially and integrated once previous stories are completed.

### Architecture Context

**Core Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Framework: Next.js 14.2+ with App Router for server components and optimal performance
- UI Framework: Custom components with Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for mobile-first responsive design

- TypeScript: 5.2+ for type safety across components and API calls
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests, Playwright for E2E testing

**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Weekly Dashboard Component Structure:**
- Primary page component: `WeeklyDashboard.tsx` in pages/ directory
- Child components: `WeekView.tsx`, `WeekNavigation.tsx`, `DayColumn.tsx` in components/calendar/
- Task display: `TaskCard.tsx` in components/task/
- Family components: `FamilyMemberAvatar.tsx`, `FamilyMemberFilter.tsx` in components/family/

**State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// Zustand store for UI state
interface AppStore {
  currentWeek: Date;
  selectedFamilyMemberId?: string;
  showQuickAdd: boolean;
  setCurrentWeek: (date: Date) => void;
  setSelectedFamilyMember: (id?: string) => void;
}

// React Query for server state
const useFamilyTasks = (weekStart: Date) => {
  const weekString = format(weekStart, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['tasks', weekString],
    queryFn: () => taskService.getTasksForWeek(weekStart),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
};
```

**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Task Interface for Display:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  familyId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  assigneeId: string;
  createdById: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  category: 'task' | 'event';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  syncVersion: number;
}
```

**FamilyMember Interface for Avatar Display:**
```typescript
interface FamilyMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  avatarColor: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'member';
}
```

**Component Specifications** [Source: architecture/components.md]

**Weekly Dashboard Component:**
- Responsibility: Primary UI component implementing weekly calendar view with family task visualization
- Key interfaces: WeekNavigationProps, TaskCardProps, FamilyMemberFilter

**Mobile-First Responsive Design** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Touch targets minimum 44px for accessibility
- Grid system responsive breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Mobile viewport optimization with proper meta tags
- Swipe gestures for week navigation (future enhancement)

**Core Workflows** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Weekly Dashboard Load Flow:**
1. User navigates to dashboard route
2. Load cached task data from IndexedDB immediately
3. Fetch latest server data with React Query
4. Display cached data, then update with server data
5. Handle empty state for new families with guidance

**Task Display Workflow:**
1. Group tasks by day within current week
2. Sort by due date and priority for visual hierarchy  
3. Show family member avatars for quick assignment identification
4. Indicate completion status with visual styling
5. Enable quick task completion with optimistic updates

### Testing Requirements

└── fixtures/
    ├── tasks.json
    └── families.json
```

**Required Test Coverage:**
- Component rendering with different task states (empty, populated, completed)
- Week navigation functionality with proper date handling
- Family member avatar display and color consistency
- Mobile responsive layout across different viewport sizes
- Accessibility compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Error handling for failed task fetches
- Optimistic UI updates for task completion

**Testing Patterns:**
```typescript
// Component test example
describe('WeeklyDashboard', () => {
  it('renders weekly calendar layout', () => {
    render(<WeeklyDashboard />, { wrapper: TestWrapper });
    expect(screen.getByTestId('week-view')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getAllByTestId('day-column')).toHaveLength(7);
  });
  
  it('displays tasks for current week', async () => {
    mockTaskService.getTasksForWeek.mockResolvedValue(mockTasks);
    render(<WeeklyDashboard />, { wrapper: TestWrapper });
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Buy groceries')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

**Security and Performance** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Implementation Rules:**
- Family Data Isolation: All task queries must include family ID filtering
- Type Safety: Use strict TypeScript interfaces for component props and state
- Offline Support: All user interactions must work offline-first with optimistic updates
- Error Boundaries: Wrap components in error boundaries for graceful failure handling

**Performance Considerations:**
- React Query caching for efficient data fetching
- Component memoization for task cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Virtualization for large task lists (future enhancement)
- Image optimization for family member avatars

### Technical Constraints

**Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Access only through config objects in utils/config.ts
- Never use process.env directly in components

**State Management Requirements:**
- Server state: React Query for API data and caching
- Client state: Zustand for UI state like current week and filters
- Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns

**API Integration:**
- Use service layer with proper error handling
- All API calls must include offline support
- Standard error handler middleware ensures consistent responses

## Testing

### Test Location Standards
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/` for component tests
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/` for full dashboard flow
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/specs/` for user workflow testing

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit and integration testing
- Playwright for E2E testing with mobile device emulation
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking in tests
- Test fixtures for consistent task and family data

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Verify weekly calendar layout renders correctly on mobile devices
- Test week navigation updates display and fetches correct data
- Validate task cards display family member information correctly
- Test empty state messaging and call-to-action functionality  
- Ensure responsive layout works across different screen sizes
- Verify accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- Test error handling for failed API requests with proper user feedback
- Validate optimistic updates work correctly for task interactions

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION** - During this comprehensive review, I identified and resolved several critical issues that were blocking the story completion. The implementation quality was already high, but the dashboard page was not using the proper component architecture that had been developed. All test failures have been resolved and the story now meets all acceptance criteria with full architectural compliance.

### Refactoring Performed

Significant refactoring was performed during this review to align the implementation with the prescribed architecture:

- **File**: `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Complete refactor to use proper component architecture instead of simplified mock implementation
  - **Why**: The dashboard page was not using the WeekNavigation, WeekView, EmptyWeekState, and other components that were properly developed according to the story requirements
  - **How**: Integrated all proper components, added family member filtering, responsive design, and proper state management using the prescribed hooks

- **File**: `/src/__tests__/hooks/useWeekNavigation.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed mock configuration for Zustand store selector pattern
  - **Why**: Tests were failing because the store mock was not properly handling the selector function pattern used by Zustand
  - **How**: Updated mock to use `mockImplementation` with proper selector function handling

- **File**: `/src/__tests__/components/task/TaskCard.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed useUpdateTask hook mocking configuration
