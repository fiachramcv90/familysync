## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 is currently in Draft status. The authentication system will build upon the foundational Next.js + Supabase integration established in Story 1.1. This story assumes the basic project structure and Supabase client configuration are already in place.

### Architecture Context

**Core Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens (managed authentication with built-in user management, MFA support, automatic token refresh)
- Backend Framework: Next.js API Routes 14.2+ (serverless functions integrated with frontend)
- Database Service: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security for family data isolation
- Frontend Framework: Next.js 14.2+ with App Router (Server Components for performance)
- Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.2+ for type safety across components and API calls
- State Management: React Query 5.0+ for server state, Zustand 4.4+ for client state

**Project Structure Alignment** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Note: The documented structure shows a monorepo setup, but implementation uses Next.js integrated approach:

│   ├── contexts/           # React contexts
│   │   └── AuthContext.tsx # Authentication context
│   └── middleware.ts       # Next.js middleware for auth
```

**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- FamilyMember: Individual user account within family context
  - id: string (UUID) - Unique user identifier
  - familyId: string - Foreign key for family data isolation
  - email: string - Authentication credential and invitation target
  - passwordHash: string - Managed by Supabase Auth
  - name: string - Display name for task ownership visual identification
  - role: 'admin' | 'member' - Admin vs Member permissions
  - avatarColor: string - Consistent color coding per front-end spec
  - isActive: boolean - Account status management
  - createdAt, updatedAt, lastSeenAt: Date - Audit trail

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
-- Family members with role-based permissions
CREATE TABLE family_members (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    family_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'member' CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'member')),
    avatar_color TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_seen_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (family_id) REFERENCES families (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
