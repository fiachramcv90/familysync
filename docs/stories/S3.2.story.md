## Dev Notes

### Current Performance Baseline

**Performance Targets:**
- **Initial Dashboard Load**: < 3 seconds on mobile 3G
- **Data Updates**: < 500ms for optimistic updates
- **Navigation**: < 200ms between dashboard sections
- **Task Interactions**: < 100ms for status changes

**Known Performance Issues:**
- Dashboard uses mock data which may not represent real-world performance
- No skeleton loading states causing poor perceived performance
- Potential query inefficiencies with current Supabase implementation
- No optimization for mobile network conditions

### Optimization Strategy

**Loading Performance Hierarchy:**
1. **Critical**: Auth state, basic dashboard layout
2. **Important**: Current week tasks, family members
3. **Secondary**: Previous/next week data, detailed statistics
4. **Background**: Historical data, analytics

**Caching Strategy:**
```typescript
// React Query optimization:
const useFamilyTasks = (weekStart: Date) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['tasks', familyId, weekString],
    queryFn: () => optimizedTaskQuery(weekStart),
    staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000,      // 2 minutes fresh
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,     // 10 minutes cache
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,    // Prevent excessive refetching
    keepPreviousData: true,         // Smooth transitions
  });
};
```

### Technical Implementation

**Skeleton Loading Design:**
- Match exact layout of actual components
- Use CSS animations for shimmer effects
- Maintain accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- Progressive reveal as data loads

**Query Optimization:**
```sql
-- Example optimized query patterns:
SELECT t.id, t.title, t.status, t.due_date, fm.name, fm.avatar_color
FROM tasks t
JOIN family_members fm ON t.assignee_id = fm.id
WHERE t.family_id = $1 
  AND t.due_date BETWEEN $2 AND $3
ORDER BY t.due_date ASC, t.priority DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Progressive Loading Implementation:**
- Load visible content first (current week)
- Background load adjacent weeks
- Lazy load historical data on demand
- Virtual scrolling for large lists

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Story S1.2 (real data integration needed for realistic performance testing)
- **Benefits**: All user interactions and dashboard experience
- **Low Risk**: Performance optimizations should not break functionality

## Testing

### Test Location Standards
- Performance tests: `src/__tests__/performance/dashboard-performance.test.ts`
- Load testing: `e2e/performance/load-testing.spec.ts`
- Caching tests: `src/__tests__/hooks/caching.test.ts`

### Performance Testing Strategy
```typescript
// Performance test examples:
describe('Dashboard Performance', () => {
  test('loads within performance budget', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    // Load dashboard
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(3000); // 3 second budget
  });
  
  test('skeleton states render immediately', () => {
    // Verify skeleton components show before data loads
  });
  
  test('caching reduces redundant requests', () => {
    // Test that repeated queries use cache
  });
});
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS measurements
- **Bundle Size**: Track JavaScript bundle growth
- **Query Performance**: Monitor database query times
