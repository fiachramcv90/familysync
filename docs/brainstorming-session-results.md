### Mind Mapping (Convergent) - 20 minutes

**Description:** Organizing generated ideas into natural clusters and identifying highest-priority category for initial development focus.

**Category Clusters Identified:**

1. **Foundation & Infrastructure** - Security, data storage, notifications, schedule integration
2. **Smart Task Management** - Effort estimation, breakdown assistance, aging trackers, prioritization  
3. **Collaboration & Sharing** - Partner coordination, shared views, family planning
4. **Intelligence & Personalization** - Mood tracking, predictive suggestions, pattern learning

**Priority Selection:** Category 3 (Collaboration & Sharing) chosen as primary focus for immediate value delivery

**Insights Discovered:**
- Ideas naturally cluster around user context (work vs. family vs. personal)
- Collaboration features offer most immediate impact for busy families
- Foundation requirements will support all categories but may not deliver visible value initially

**Critical User Journey Identified:**
19. Sunday night planning ritual - shared weekly review and coordination session over tea

**Notable Connections:**
- All categories eventually interconnect (shared data needs security, collaboration benefits from intelligence)
- Starting with collaboration provides clear user value while building toward more advanced features
- Sunday night ritual represents the perfect user adoption moment - regular, intimate, high-value

**Synthesis - Ideal User Experience:**
20. Main screen: Weekly calendar view with drill-down capability (double-click days)
21. Multi-user event creation capabilities for both partners
22. Organized subsections: events/meetings, tasks, meals with weekly summary view

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Role playing revealed distinct user contexts with different needs (family vs. work vs. personal)
- "What if" scenarios pushed beyond conventional to-do app thinking into intelligent assistance
- Convergent mind mapping naturally organized ideas into actionable categories
- Real user journey (Sunday tea planning) provided concrete design target

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Technical architecture**: How to handle real-time collaboration with offline capabilities
- **User onboarding**: How couples discover and adopt shared planning workflows  
- **Integration strategies**: Connecting with existing calendars, email, messaging platforms
- **Scalability concerns**: Supporting families with multiple children and complex schedules

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **User Journey Mapping**: Detail the complete Sunday night planning flow from opening app to closing
- **Technical Brainstorming**: Focus session on React/Spring Boot architecture decisions
- **Competitive Analysis**: Research existing family coordination and shared to-do solutions
- **Assumption Testing**: Validate that weekly calendar view matches mental models of target users

### Questions That Emerged
- How do we handle conflicting edits when both partners modify the same item simultaneously?
- Should the app support more than 2 users (extended family, babysitters, etc.)?
- What's the minimum viable sharing functionality that would drive adoption?
- How do we transition users from individual to shared planning mindsets?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Technical architecture deep-dive, user onboarding flow design, competitive landscape analysis
- **Recommended timeframe:** 2-3 weeks to allow initial research and design sketching
- **Preparation needed:** Install and test 3-5 existing family coordination apps, sketch initial UI concepts, research React calendar libraries
