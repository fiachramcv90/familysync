schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "Authentication System Foundation"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Authentication system functionality fully validated (18/18 tests passing) and build pipeline restored. However, broader quality issues persist: 38 failing tests, 26+ TypeScript errors."

    suggested_owner: dev
    impact: "Build skips type validation, potential runtime issues in non-auth areas"

    description: "50+ ESLint violations mostly in test files and non-critical areas"
    suggested_owner: dev
    impact: "Code quality could be improved but doesn't block authentication functionality"

nfr_validation:
  security: 
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication system fully validated (18/18 tests passing). JWT handling, password validation, RLS policies, rate limiting all verified."
  performance:
    status: PASS  
    notes: "Build pipeline restored and working. Application builds successfully for production deployment."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Core authentication reliable (100% test pass rate). Broader system has 38 failing tests in non-auth areas."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Authentication code maintainable with clean tests. TypeScript errors in non-auth areas need attention."
