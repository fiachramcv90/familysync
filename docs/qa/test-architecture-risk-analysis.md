## CRITICAL RISK AREAS ⚠️

### 1. Offline-First Sync Engine
**Risk Level:** HIGHEST  
**Impact:** Data consistency, user experience, family coordination reliability

#### Risk Profile
- **Sync Conflicts:** Version mismatches during concurrent family member updates
- **State Transitions:** Network connectivity changes during operations
- **Race Conditions:** Multiple optimistic updates before server confirmation
- **Data Corruption:** IndexedDB transaction failures during offline operations
- **Background Sync:** Service Worker queue overflow and prioritization failures

#### Test Architecture Requirements
```yaml
test_scenarios:
  sync_conflicts:
    - given: Two family members edit same task offline
      when: Both come online simultaneously  
      then: Conflict resolution UI appears with merge options
    - given: Task updated with outdated syncVersion
      when: API receives conflicting update
      then: 409 response with latest version provided
  
  network_transitions:
    - given: User creating task while online
      when: Network drops mid-request
      then: Task queued for background sync with offline indicator
    - given: Offline changes queued
      when: Network restored
      then: Automatic sync with exponential backoff retry
  
  race_conditions:
    - given: Multiple optimistic updates to same task
      when: Network responses arrive out of order
      then: Final state matches latest server version
```

#### Required Test Coverage
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI workflows (manual merge)
- [ ] Automatic conflict resolution logic (last-write-wins vs merge)
- [ ] Network transition edge cases (airplane mode scenarios)
- [ ] IndexedDB corruption recovery
- [ ] Service Worker background sync reliability
- [ ] Optimistic update rollback scenarios

### 2. Family Data Isolation  
**Risk Level:** HIGHEST  
**Impact:** Data security, privacy compliance, trust

#### Risk Profile
- **Data Leakage:** Cross-family task/event visibility
- **Authorization Bypass:** API route family ID validation failures  
- **Database Injection:** Family ID parameter tampering
- **Session Hijacking:** JWT family claim manipulation

#### Test Architecture Requirements
```yaml
security_scenarios:
  data_boundaries:
    - given: User authenticated to Family A
      when: Attempts to access Family B task via direct API call
      then: 403 Forbidden with family access violation
    - given: Malicious JWT with modified familyId claim
      when: Any API endpoint accessed
      then: Token validation fails, 401 Unauthorized
  
  database_isolation:
    - given: SQL injection attempt with family ID bypass
      when: Task query executed
      then: Parameterized query prevents injection
    - given: Family member removed from family
      when: Cached JWT used for API access
      then: Family membership re-validation blocks access
```

#### Required Test Coverage
- [ ] Multi-tenant data boundary penetration testing
- [ ] JWT family claim validation across all API routes
- [ ] Database query family ID filtering enforcement
- [ ] Cross-family data access attempt scenarios
- [ ] Family invitation code security testing

### 3. Authentication & JWT Security
**Risk Level:** HIGHEST  
**Impact:** Account security, family invitation abuse, session management

#### Risk Profile
- **Token Lifecycle:** 15-minute expiry with refresh token rotation
- **Family Invitations:** Invitation code generation and validation security
- **Rate Limiting:** Brute force protection effectiveness
- **Password Security:** bcrypt implementation and breach protection

#### Test Architecture Requirements
```yaml
auth_scenarios:
  token_management:
    - given: Access token expires (15 min)
      when: API request made with expired token
      then: 401 response triggers refresh token flow
    - given: Refresh token used
      when: New access token generated
      then: Old refresh token invalidated (rotation)
  
  rate_limiting:
    - given: 5 failed login attempts in 15 minutes
      when: 6th attempt made
      then: Account temporarily locked, rate limit enforced
    - given: 100 requests per minute limit
      when: 101st request made in same minute
      then: 429 Too Many Requests response
  
  invitation_security:
    - given: Family invitation code generated
      when: Code attempts brute force guessing
      then: Rate limiting prevents enumeration
```

#### Required Test Coverage
- [ ] Token lifecycle management (expiry, refresh, rotation)
- [ ] Family invitation code security (generation/validation)
- [ ] Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- [ ] JWT signature validation and claim tampering attempts
- [ ] Password policy enforcement and breach database checking

### 4. PWA Service Worker Integrity
**Risk Level:** HIGHEST  
**Impact:** Offline functionality, cache integrity, sync reliability

#### Risk Profile
- **Cache Strategy Conflicts:** Cache-first vs network-first inconsistencies
- **Service Worker Lifecycle:** Update deployment and cache invalidation
- **Background Sync Failures:** Queue overflow and sync prioritization
- **Cache Poisoning:** Malicious cache injection attempts

#### Test Architecture Requirements
```yaml
pwa_scenarios:
  cache_integrity:
    - given: App shell cached with cache-first strategy
      when: Backend API updated with breaking changes
      then: Service worker detects version mismatch, updates cache
    - given: Background sync queue contains 100+ items
      when: Network restored after extended offline period
      then: Sync prioritization processes critical items first
  
  service_worker_lifecycle:
    - given: New service worker version deployed
      when: User has app open with old version
      then: Update prompt shown, cache invalidated on accept
    - given: IndexedDB transaction fails during offline operation
      when: Data corruption detected
      then: Automatic recovery with server sync reconciliation
```

#### Required Test Coverage

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### Given-When-Then Scenario Mapping
All test scenarios follow Given-When-Then pattern for requirements traceability:

```gherkin
Feature: Offline Sync Conflict Resolution
  
  Scenario: Concurrent Family Member Task Updates
    Given two family members are editing the same task offline
    And both make different changes to the task title
    When both devices come back online simultaneously
    Then a conflict resolution UI should appear
    And both versions should be presented for user selection
    And the selected version should sync to all family devices
    And the conflict should be logged for audit purposes
```

### Test Data Strategy
- **Family Isolation:** Each test family uses isolated data sets
- **User Personas:** Test scenarios cover Admin vs Member role differences
- **Device Coverage:** Mobile-first with cross-browser PWA testing
- **Network Conditions:** Offline, slow 3G, WiFi, edge case transitions

### Automation Strategy
