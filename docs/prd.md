# FamilySync Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Eliminate "who's doing what" coordination conversations and conflicts in busy professional families
- Provide dead-simple shared family calendar visibility that works reliably on mobile devices
- Ensure critical family tasks (appointments, responsibilities, household items) don't fall through cracks
- Enable quick mobile coordination checks during busy family moments without behavior change requirements
- Achieve 1,000 active family pairs within 6 months and 70% retention after 3 months
- Reduce average family planning sessions from 60+ minutes to under 20 minutes

### Background Context

**FamilySync** addresses a critical gap in family coordination for busy professionals managing complex dual-career households. The current landscape lacks mobile-first solutions that provide simple shared task visibility without requiring behavioral changes or complex collaboration features. While individual productivity apps serve personal needs and shared calendars handle events, no existing solution effectively bridges family task coordination with the quick, mobile-accessible interface that matches how busy families actually coordinate throughout their day.

This PRD builds upon comprehensive brainstorming research identifying 22 distinct feature concepts and validates the core assumption that families need shared responsibility visibility more than advanced productivity features. The mobile-first PWA approach specifically targets the 25-50 demographic of working professionals who require reliable, simple tools over feature-rich complexity.

### User Research Foundation

**Brainstorming Session Validation (August 2025):**
- **22 feature concepts** generated across role-playing with Working Parent, Busy Professional, and Solo Goal-Oriented perspectives
- **Critical user journey identified:** Sunday night tea planning ritual as optimal adoption moment
- **Primary pain points validated:** Coordination between partners, daily prioritization overwhelm, shared responsibility tracking gaps
- **Natural mental model confirmed:** Weekly calendar view with multi-category organization (events/tasks/meals)

**Key User Insights:**
- "Coordination and visibility between partners is crucial" - Working Parent perspective
- "Request management and aging awareness critical for work efficiency" - Professional perspective  
- "Planning ahead reduces decision fatigue regardless of context" - Cross-perspective insight
