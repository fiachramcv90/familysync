# FamilySync UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for FamilySync's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Busy Working Parent:** Dual-career professionals (ages 25-50) managing complex household coordination. Need quick, reliable access to family tasks during brief coordination moments throughout the day. Value simplicity over feature complexity.

**Partner/Spouse:** The other half of the dual-career household. Requires seamless async collaboration and clear visibility into family responsibilities without behavioral change requirements. Prefers mobile-first interactions.

### Usability Goals

1. **Instant comprehension:** Family members can understand weekly coordination status within 3 seconds of app open
2. **One-thumb efficiency:** All critical functions accessible with single-handed phone operation during busy moments
3. **Glance-and-Go navigation:** Primary information visible without scrolling or drilling down into multiple screens
4. **Offline reliability:** Full functionality maintained during 7-day network outages with seamless sync recovery
5. **Ritual integration:** Natural fit into existing family planning sessions (Sunday night tea planning)

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize immediate visual comprehension over aesthetic innovation during high-stress coordination moments
2. **Mobile-first reliability** - Every interaction must work flawlessly on phone screens with poor network conditions  
3. **Async-by-default** - Design for family members coordinating at different times without requiring simultaneous presence
4. **Visual status communication** - Use color coding and icons to convey task ownership and completion instantly without reading
5. **Context-aware efficiency** - Smart defaults and pre-filling based on family patterns to minimize input during busy moments

| Wide | 1440px | - | Desktop monitors, optional enhancement |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement - single column on mobile expands to multi-column grid on larger screens

**Navigation Changes:** Bottom tab bar on mobile, sidebar navigation on desktop, contextual navigation maintained across breakpoints

**Content Priority:** Task cards remain primary focus across all breakpoints, secondary information progressively disclosed on larger screens

**Interaction Changes:** Touch-optimized on mobile (44px targets), mouse/keyboard optimized on desktop with hover states

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Subtle, purposeful animations that provide feedback and guide attention without overwhelming users during busy coordination moments. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings.

### Key Animations
- **Task Completion:** Gentle scale + fade with checkmark appearance (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Page Transitions:** Slide transitions for week navigation (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton shimmer for content loading (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: linear)
- **Error Feedback:** Subtle shake animation for form validation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Sync Status:** Gentle pulse for offline indicators (Duration: 2s loop, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** <3 seconds from tap to interactive weekly view on mobile
- **Interaction Response:** <100ms visual feedback for all user actions
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all motion design

### Design Strategies
Optimized asset delivery, lazy loading for non-critical content, efficient component rendering patterns, and progressive image enhancement supporting the offline-first architecture.

## Technical Architecture Integration

### Frontend-Backend Architecture Overview

**Next.js + Supabase Stack** chosen to optimally support the defined UX goals:

- **Next.js App Router** provides file-based routing that maps directly to our IA structure
- **Server Components** enable fast initial loads for the Weekly Dashboard (<3 second goal)
- **API Routes** handle family data operations with optimal caching strategies
- **Supabase Real-time** powers live family coordination updates without page refresh

### Component-Backend Integration Patterns

#### Weekly Dashboard Data Flow
```
Weekly Dashboard (Server Component) 
  → Next.js API Route (/api/families/[id]/week/[date])
    → Supabase query with RLS filtering
      → Real-time subscription for live updates
```

#### Quick Add Task Flow
```
Quick Add Modal (Client Component)
  → Optimistic UI update (immediate visual feedback)
    → Next.js API Route (/api/tasks)
      → Supabase insert with family isolation
        → Real-time broadcast to family members
```

### Offline-First Implementation

**Service Worker + IndexedDB Strategy:**
- Service worker caches Next.js pages and API responses
- IndexedDB stores family data with 7-day retention
- Background sync queues offline actions for Supabase integration
- Conflict resolution via Supabase's built-in timestamp ordering

### Performance Architecture

**Supabase Optimization for UX Goals:**
- **Edge Functions** pre-compute weekly views for <3 second loads
- **Connection pooling** ensures consistent API response times
- **Row Level Security** eliminates backend family filtering overhead
- **Real-time subscriptions** reduce polling for live coordination updates

### Security Integration

**Supabase Auth + Next.js Middleware:**
- JWT tokens managed by Supabase Auth (automatic refresh)
- Next.js middleware validates family access on every route
- RLS policies prevent cross-family data access at database level
- API routes inherit family context from authenticated user

### Scalability Considerations

**Benefits of Supabase + Next.js for Solo Developer:**
- **No database migration needed** - PostgreSQL from day one supports 10,000+ families
- **Automatic scaling** - Vercel + Supabase handle traffic spikes during family planning sessions
- **Built-in monitoring** - Supabase dashboard provides performance insights
- **Simplified auth flow** - Reduces authentication implementation complexity by 80%

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review this specification with stakeholders for validation and feedback
2. Create detailed visual designs in Figma based on component specifications
3. **Set up Supabase project** with family data schema and RLS policies
