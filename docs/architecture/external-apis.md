# External APIs

No external APIs are required for the MVP implementation. FamilySync is designed as a self-contained family coordination system to maintain simplicity and avoid external dependencies that could impact offline functionality.

**Future Considerations:**
- Email service (SendGrid/Mailgun) for invitation emails when scaling beyond 1,000 families
- Push notification service for mobile engagement
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar/iCloud) for enhanced family coordination
